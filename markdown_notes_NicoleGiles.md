When pushing my Markdown files to GitHub, I found that there were a lot of small errors I needed to fix in order for the formatting to work. First, I had to add doublespaces after each line so that my definitions wouldn't turn into one large run-on paragraph. I also had to go back and add **bold** text to some of the terms/functions that I had wanted to be bold.  

I found that my 'muddiest point' file just wasn't formatting at all but just showing as the original text. It turns out that I had put an extra quotation mark somewhere in the title. These little errors are what has made the process a little longer than I thought. However I am glad that I am able to chug along and eventually produce the product I was trying to achieve. 

I am not sure how my Quarto notes are supposed to look. Are they supposed to have a similar formatted output as my Markdown notes? My Quarto notes are still looking a bit unformatted but I can't figure out where in the process I could have messed it up.
