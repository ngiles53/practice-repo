#Chapter 3, *dplyr*: Muddiest Point

I am mostly having trouble with the exercises. While the examples make sense, I am having trouble knowing when to use which functions on my own. Do some of the functions from this chapter not work/work differently with character variables versus numbers? I feel as if I need more guidance through an exercise in real time. Right now, everything is just 'vocabulary' that has pretty intuitive names (group by, select, arrange, etc.)
